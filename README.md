# virgilTest

This is an extremely barebones implementation of Virgil Card Manager.

1)Run server.py and open up a web browser and go to http://127.0.0.1:5000 in your web browser. 
2)Type in a simple word into the first textbox, open up the web console and type in sendMessagePost()
3)Copy everything after "messageJWT", but on the same line. This is a Javascript Web Token.
4)Paste the JWT into the second box and type sendJWT() in the web browser.
5)Check the terminal running server.py for the error.
